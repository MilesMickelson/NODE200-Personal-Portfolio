Personal sample portfolio project with links and a contact page using EJS, preferring to develop code with 
React I will have another repository/website for you to view for this. Keeping this repository open for 
the sake of showing a fullstacks coursework 100% completed as I gained valuable lessons and knowledge out 
of this project even only completing its minimal requirements/recommendations.

#### Please feel free to review the code in this repository as there is no front end feature to visualize.
